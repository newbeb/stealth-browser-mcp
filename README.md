# Stealth Browser MCP Server

An [MCP (Model Context Protocol)](https://modelcontextprotocol.ai) server that provides stealth browser capabilities using Playwright with anti-detection techniques. This server allows MCP clients to navigate to websites and take screenshots while evading common bot detection systems.

## Features

- **Stealth Mode**: Uses [puppeteer-extra-plugin-stealth](https://github.com/berstend/puppeteer-extra/tree/master/packages/puppeteer-extra-plugin-stealth) with [playwright-extra](https://github.com/berstend/puppeteer-extra/tree/master/packages/playwright-extra) to bypass bot detections
  - Modifies browser fingerprints to appear as regular user traffic
  - Handles WebGL, canvas, font, plugin and other browser fingerprinting techniques
- **Screenshot Tool**: Take full-page or element-specific screenshots of any website
  - Supports both headless (default) and visible browser modes
- **MCP Integration**: Exposes browser capabilities via Model Context Protocol

## Installation

## Technical Details

This project uses:
- [FastMCP](https://github.com/punkpeye/fastmcp) for the MCP server implementation
- [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/) for browser automation
- [playwright-extra](https://github.com/berstend/puppeteer-extra/tree/master/packages/playwright-extra) for plugin support
- [puppeteer-extra-plugin-stealth](https://github.com/berstend/puppeteer-extra/tree/master/packages/puppeteer-extra-plugin-stealth) for avoiding bot detection
